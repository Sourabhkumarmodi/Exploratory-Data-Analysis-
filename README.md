# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analysis approach that helps identify general patterns in data, such as outliers and unexpected features. It's an important first step in any data analysis process. EDA involves three main tasks: Dataset overview and descriptive statistics, Feature assessment and visualization, and Data quality evaluation.

There are three types of EDA we generally learn when we start our career as a data analyst :
1. Univariate EDA : In Univariate we deals with only one feature/ column of the dataset.
2. Bivariate EDA : In Bivariate we deals with two features/ columns of the dataset.
3. Multivariate EDA : In Multivariate we deals with more then two features/ columns of the dataset.

Basically I used three dataset for understanding about the EDA process.
